**Primary Goal:-** Snapchat is a social media application that uses visualisation to share multimedia content, such as images and movies. Millions of individuals use social media every day, making it a massive network that generates a lot of data. This data can also be used by marketers to engage with users and find out what kind of content resonates with followers.

**Solution and results:-** I have performed initial data analysis on data using python and did exploratory data analysis to understand the data in an obvious way. Using the clean data, have created two effective dashboards which convey clear information about the usage of snapchat and most useful insights to the end user using Tableau.
